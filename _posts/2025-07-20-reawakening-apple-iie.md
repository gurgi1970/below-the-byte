Today was the first step in my 10K journey with Retro Computing and relearning old skills, while developing new ones. I turned on my Apple IIe computer, many years after having last worked on one during the 1980's in high school.

Started by relearning the basics of navigating the computer again. Getting familiar with how to display a directory `CATALOG`, clearning the screen `HOME`, booting directly into Apple BASIC and also booting with a 5.25" floppy disk.

Wow did the memories flood back. I would have loved to boot up a game of **_Karateka_**, **_Lode Runner_**, or even **_Oregon Trail_**, if I had working copies of them.

### What I Learned

The structure came back quicker that I expected. While redumentary, the logic remains elegant. I remembered the trhirll of booting up the computer while sitting in computer lab at school and getting ready to code or play a game.

### What's Next?

Get familiar again with simple BASIC commands, `PRINT`, `GOTO`, `INPUT`, `HOME`, `FOR/NEXT` loops. Try to create a simple text menu, that keeps looping (reshowing the menu) until a valid input is selected.
