Hi, I’m James.

I was born in 1970, which means I grew up right alongside the golden age of personal computing and home consoles. My earliest memories of technology include the satisfying click of Apple IIe keys, the bright blip of the Atari 2600, and the hypnotic hum of a Commodore 64 loading a game off a 5.25" disk.

## The Early Bytes

As a kid, I was drawn to machines that didn’t just entertain — they invited me to **create**.  
- On the **Apple IIe**, I played *Karateka*, *Lode Runner*, *Below the Root*, *Oregon Trail*, and *Zork* — I was facinated with how these games played and enjoyed the entertainment from playing them, but soon I wanted to know how were these games created. I soon learned to code simple BASIC programs that showed menus, animations, and even wrote to disk.
- The **Commodore 64**, I played *The Bard's Tale*, which introduced me to a whole new style of graphics and sound, and more advanced file operations.
- The **TI-99/4A** was quirky and different, and it taught me how every machine had its own logic.
- With the **Atari 2600**, I learned how gameplay could be distilled into something pure and endlessly replayable.

Back then, I didn’t know what “software development” was — I just knew I wanted to make the screen respond to me.

## Today’s Journey

Now, I’m circling back.  
I'm working through what I call my **10k HP Journey** — inspired by Yu-kai Chou’s framework for meaningful growth. The goal is to earn 10,000 experience points over time by:
- Relearning the fundamentals of programming (starting with BASIC, Pascal, Assembly, and moving to Python, JS, and modern web stacks)
- Building tools, personal projects, and creative systems
- Exploring worldbuilding, storytelling, and RPG design
- Tracking and reflecting on everything I learn

I use this site to **log my journey**, and GitHub to **show my progress**.  
It’s not about speed — it’s about **depth** and **intent**.

## Why I’m Doing This

Like many people, I’ve had hobbies that come and go. But my passion for retro systems, game logic, and creative problem-solving never really left. I’m doing this now because:
- I want to **reconnect** with what first inspired me
- I want to build **something of my own**
- And I want to **see how far I can go** when I stop starting over

## What’s Next

I’m currently working through a series of programming projects on real hardware and modern platforms. I’ll be sharing logs, reflections, and builds here. If you're doing something similar — or just starting — I hope you’ll follow along.

This site will grow with me. So check back.  
The journey’s only just begun.
