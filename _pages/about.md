Hi, I’m James.

I was born in 1970, which means I grew up right alongside the golden age of personal computing and home consoles. My earliest memories of technology include the satisfying click of Apple IIe keys, the bright blip of the Atari 2600, and the hypnotic hum of a Commodore 64 loading a game off a 5.25" disk.

## The Early Bytes

As a kid, I was drawn to machines that didn’t just entertain — they invited me to **create**.  
- On the **Apple IIe**, I played *Karateka*, *Lode Runner*, *Below the Root*, *Oregon Trail*, and *Zork* — I was facinated with how these games played and enjoyed the entertainment from playing them, but soon I wanted to know how were these games created. I soon learned to code simple BASIC programs that showed menus, animations, and even wrote to disk.
- The **Commodore 64**, I played *The Bard's Tale*, which introduced me to a whole new style of graphics and sound, and more advanced file operations.
- The **TI-99/4A** was quirky and different, and it taught me how every machine had its own logic.
- With the **Atari 2600**, I learned how gameplay could be distilled into something pure and endlessly replayable.

Back then, I didn’t know what “software development” was — I just knew I wanted to make the screen respond to me.

## Today's Journey

I'm working through what I call my **10K HP Journey** — a personal quest inspired by Yu-kai Chou's framework for meaningful growth and motivation. The goal? To earn 10,000 experience points in each of the major areas of my life, not all at once — but slowly, deliberately, and in a way that reflects how I truly want to grow.

I’ve done this before in pieces. Now, I’m circling back to do it more intentionally.

### Retro Computing & Software Development

I’m retracing the path that sparked my love of computing — starting with languages I used as a kid on the Apple IIe, Commodore 64, and TI-99/4A:
- Relearning **Apple BASIC**, **TI BASIC**, **Commodore BASIC**, and then moving forward to:
- **Pascal**, **Fortran**, **BAL**, and **COBOL**
- Eventually transitioning into **modern languages** like Python, JavaScript, CSS, and full web development stacks
- Along the way, I'm building personal tools, project logs, and hobbyist systems to support other areas of my journey

### Writing, Worldbuilding & RPG Design

Words and worlds matter to me — so I’m spending focused time:
- Creating deep lore for my fantasy world *Elarindor*
- Writing short stories and character arcs (like Vaelyn and Toma)
- Designing tabletop RPG systems and tools grounded in narrative meaning

This is as much about creative expression as it is about discipline and structure.

### Health & Wellbeing

This journey only works if I’m around to complete it.

So:
- I’m tracking daily movement (with a goal of 10,000+ steps a day)
- Managing blood sugar and insulin carefully
- Taking time to reflect, recharge, and log mental health progress when needed

---

### Progress, Not Perfection

None of this is rigid or polished. Some days are productive, others are quiet — and that’s okay. What matters is that I keep moving forward, a few HP at a time.

## Why I’m Doing This

Like many people, I’ve had hobbies that come and go. But my passion for retro systems, game logic, and creative problem-solving never really left. I’m doing this now because:
- I want to **reconnect** with what first inspired me
- I want to build **something of my own**
- And I want to **see how far I can go** when I stop starting over

---

## What’s Next

I’m currently working through a series of programming projects on real hardware and modern platforms. I’ll be sharing logs, reflections, and builds here. If you're doing something similar — or just starting — I hope you’ll follow along.

This site will grow with me. So check back.  
The journey’s only just begun.
