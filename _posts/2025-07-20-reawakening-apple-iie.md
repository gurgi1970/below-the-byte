Today I powered on the Apple IIe for the first time in years. I began with a simple text menu in BASIC. It displayed options for mock inventory, spellbook, and exit. I also reviewed basic `PRINT`, `GOTO`, and `INPUT` commands.

### What I Learned
The structure came back quicker than expected. While rudimentary, the logic remains elegant. I remembered the thrill of typing code that responded.

### What's Next
I plan to add file I/O, so the menu writes and reads a character sheet from disk.
