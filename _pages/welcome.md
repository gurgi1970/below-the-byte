Hi, I’m James.

This blog is part of my 10,000 HP Journey — a long-term project focused on growth through learning, creativity, and discipline. I'm starting from where I began: the Apple IIe and the thrill of typing my first lines of code.

Here, I’ll:
- Log my coding experiments (both retro and modern)
- Reflect on what I’m learning
- Track my HP progress (inspired by Yu-kai Chou’s 10k HP framework)
- Occasionally dive into worldbuilding and creative projects

Thanks for reading.
