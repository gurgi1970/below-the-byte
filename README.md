# Welcome to Below the Byte

This is my 10,000 HP Journey â€” a long-term personal challenge to grow through learning, creativity, and consistency.  
Here, I plan to explore systems: from retro computing and BASIC to web development, storytelling, and beyond.

## What is this?

**Below the Byte** is my personal blog and documentation space used for following **Yu-Kai Chou's** _<a href="https://10khp.com">10K HP Journey</a>, every task, reflection, or project earns me XP (HP). The goal is to grow towards mastery through slow, consistent progress..

You can track my milestone log <a href="https://gurgi1970.github.io/below-the-byte/_pages/milestones.md">here</a>.
