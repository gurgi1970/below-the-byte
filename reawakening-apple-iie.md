title: Reawakening the Apple IIe
---

Today I powered on the Apple IIe for the first time in years. I began with a simple text menu in BASIC. It displayed options for mock inventory, spellbook, and exit.

### What I Learned
The structure came back quicker than expected. While rudimentary, the logic remains elegant.

### What's Next
I plan to add file I/O to save and load character data.
