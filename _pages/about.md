My name is James.

I’m revisiting the world of retro computing, creative design, and software development through the lens of my 10k HP Journey — a challenge of growth and discovery. This blog tracks my learning, from Apple IIe nostalgia to modern programming.

You may also see references to characters like Vaelyn and Dnaria — voices I use to help explore ideas and creativity. But this blog starts simply: just me, writing, learning, and leveling up.
