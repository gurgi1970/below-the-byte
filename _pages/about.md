# About Me

Hi, I’m James.

I was born in 1970, which means I grew up right alongside the golden age of personal computing and home consoles. My earliest memories of technology include the satisfying click of Apple IIe keys, the bright blip of the Atari 2600, and the hypnotic hum of a Commodore 64 loading a game off a 5.25" disk.

## The Early Bytes

As a kid, I was drawn to machines that didn’t just entertain — they invited me to **create**.

- On the **Apple IIe**, I played *Karateka*, *Lode Runner*, *Below the Root*, *Oregon Trail*, and *Zork*. I was fascinated by how these games worked. Eventually, I wanted to know how they were made. So I started writing my own BASIC programs — simple menus, animations, and even routines that read from and wrote to disk.
- On the **Commodore 64**, games like *The Bard's Tale* introduced me to richer sound, graphics, and more advanced data handling.
- The **TI-99/4A** was quirky and unique, teaching me that every system had its own logic and quirks.
- With the **Atari 2600**, I learned how gameplay could be distilled into something pure and endlessly replayable.

I didn’t know what “software development” was back then — I just knew I wanted the screen to respond to me.

## Today's Journey

I'm working through what I call my **10K HP Journey** — a personal quest inspired by Yu-kai Chou's framework for meaningful growth and motivation. The goal? To earn 10,000 experience points in each major area of my life. Not all at once — but slowly, deliberately, and in a way that reflects how I truly want to grow.

I’ve done this before in pieces. Now, I’m circling back to do it with intention.

### Retro Computing & Software Development

I’m retracing the path that first sparked my love of tech — starting with the languages I used as a kid:

- Relearning **Apple BASIC**, **TI BASIC**, **Commodore BASIC**
- Progressing through **Pascal**, **Fortran**, **BAL**, and **COBOL**
- Transitioning to modern tools like **Python**, **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and full web development stacks

Along the way, I'm building personal tools, project logs, and creative systems that bridge the old with the new.

### Writing, Worldbuilding & RPG Design

Words and worlds matter to me. I’m spending time:

- Creating deep lore for my fantasy world *Elarindor*
- Writing short stories and character arcs (like Vaelyn and Toma)
- Designing tabletop RPG systems and mechanics grounded in narrative meaning

This is both a creative outlet and a structured discipline I want to keep sharpening.

### Health & Wellbeing

This journey only works if I’m around to complete it.

So I’m:

- Tracking daily movement (goal: 10,000+ steps a day)
- Carefully managing blood sugar and insulin
- Logging mental health progress and allowing space to recharge when needed

### Progress, Not Perfection

Not every day is productive. Some days are quiet — and that’s okay. The important thing is to keep moving forward, a few HP at a time.

## Why "Below the Byte"?

I've spent alot of my life behind the &mdash; building things, hiding behind avatars, or finding conflict in systems. "Below the Byte" is a name that reminds me to go deeper: not just into code, but into **myself** &mdash; understanding the "why" behind everything I do.

## What’s Next

Right now, I’m working through a series of programming projects — both on real retro hardware and modern platforms.

I’ll be sharing logs, reflections, and experiments here. If you're doing something similar (or just starting your own 10K HP Journey), I hope you’ll follow along.

This site will grow with me.

Check back.  
The journey’s just beginning.
